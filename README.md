# üìä Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will **churn** (leave the telecom service) based on their demographic and service usage patterns.  
It uses **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)** for data analysis and machine learning, and **Streamlit** for deployment as an interactive web app.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Problem Statement**  
   A telecom company wants to reduce customer churn. The goal is to identify key churn factors and predict which customers are at risk of leaving.  

2. **Dataset**  
   The dataset contains customer details such as:  
   - Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)  
   - Services (Internet, Phone, Streaming, Online Security, etc.)  
   - Contract details (monthly charges, total charges, contract type, payment method, etc.)  
   - Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)  

3. **Steps Performed**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing (`pandas`)  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `matplotlib`  
   - Train/Validation split  
   - Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`) and categorical encoding (`OneHotEncoder`)  
   - Model training: **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC  
   - Deployment with **Streamlit**

## üîë Key Insights

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **electronic check payments** are more likely to churn.  
- Higher **monthly charges** correlate with higher churn probability.  
- Senior citizens and customers without **online security/tech support** also show higher churn rates.
